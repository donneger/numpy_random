### Summary of the Assignment

The objective of this notebook is to provide a summary of the **numpy.random** package in Python and to demonstrate through examples some of the principal features of the package. There are 4 sections in the notebook as follows:

- Section 1. Explain the overall purpose of the package. 
- Section 2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 
- Section 3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions. 
- Section 4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

The following are the pre-requisites to run the notebook:

1. The notebook can be found at this link in Github. 

*https://github.com/donneger/numpy_random*

2. Download the notebook using the Download ZIP and extract the files to a folder on your PC. 

3. Ensure the following packages are installed on your PC
- Jupyter
- numpy
- matlplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy.stats

If these packages are not intalled it is recommended to install Ananconda, instructions on installation can be found [***here***](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html), as this has most of the commononly used Python packages. 

Alernatively they can be installed individually using pip install. 

4. Open a Jupyter notebook (or Jupyter Lab) session on your PC, open and run the file **random.ipynb**.
